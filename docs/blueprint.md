# **App Name**: Firmware Insights

## Core Features:

- File Uploader: Enables users to upload firmware .bin files and bootlog.txt files via drag-and-drop or a file selection dialog.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust, security, and intelligence; avoids cliches.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F5F5FA) for a clean, modern, uncluttered aesthetic.
- Accent color: Bright Orange (#FF9800) to highlight important actions and alerts, with good contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, offering a modern and neutral aesthetic.
- Use consistent and clear icons for file types, security findings, and navigation elements.
- Employ a modular layout with clear divisions for each section (file upload, analysis results, dashboard).
- Subtle animations during the file analysis process to indicate progress and keep the user engaged.
